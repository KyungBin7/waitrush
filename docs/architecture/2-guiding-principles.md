# 2. Guiding Principles
* **Modularity & Scalability:** Leverage Nest.js's module-based structure for clear separation of concerns, promoting scalability and maintainability.
* **Robustness & Reliability:** Implement strong validation, error handling, and security measures.
* **Performance:** Optimize API endpoints for fast response times and efficient data processing.
* **Security:** Ensure secure authentication, authorization, and data handling (e.g., password hashing, input sanitization).
* **Maintainability:** Write clean, testable, and well-documented code following Nest.js best practices.
