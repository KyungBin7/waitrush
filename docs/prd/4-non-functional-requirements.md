* **Performance:**
    * Ultra-fast page load times (e.g., under 1.5 seconds) for both organizers (dashboard, forms) and participants (public pages).
    * Highly responsive UI, ensuring smooth animations and interactions for a premium feel.
    * Ability to handle a high volume of concurrent organizer actions and participant sign-ups efficiently, leveraging Nest.js's performance.

    * Secure storage and protection of all user data (emails, organizer info).
    * Comprehensive spam and bot protection for waitlist submissions.

* **Usability (UI/UX):**
    * **Strict adherence to macOS-style trendy design principles:** Consistent use of subtle translucency, refined typography, crisp iconography, fluid micro-interactions, clean aesthetics, subtle shadows, and ample white space across both public and authenticated views.
    * Intuitive navigation and clear calls to action for both user types.
    * Fully responsive design for a seamless and aesthetically pleasing experience across all modern devices.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase for both frontend (lovable) and backend (Nest.js) should be clean, modular, well-documented, and follow established best practices for their respective frameworks.
* **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for inclusive usability.
