# Social Login Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Implement Google and GitHub social login functionality to provide users with convenient authentication options while maintaining compatibility with the existing email-based authentication system.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current relevant functionality:** Email-based authentication system with JWT tokens
- **Technology stack:** 
  - Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, React Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
  - Backend: NestJS, MongoDB with Mongoose, Passport JWT, bcrypt for password hashing
- **Integration points:** 
  - Frontend: AuthContext, LoginForm/SignupForm components
  - Backend: Auth module with JWT strategy, Organizer schema

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's being added/changed:** 
  - Social login buttons (Google & GitHub) on login/signup forms
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication flow implementation
  - Backend endpoints for social authentication
  - User profile merging for existing email accounts
- **How it integrates:** 
  - Extends existing auth system without breaking current JWT-based flow
  - Social login generates same JWT tokens as email login
  - UI components follow existing design patterns with shadcn/ui
- **Success criteria:** 
  - Users can sign up/login using Google or GitHub accounts
  - Existing email-based auth continues to work
  - Social login users receive JWT tokens for API access
  - Seamless UI integration with current design

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Frontend Social Login UI Integration**
   - Add Google and GitHub login buttons to LoginForm and SignupForm components
   - Implement OAuth redirect handling and callback pages
   - Update AuthContext to support social authentication methods

2. **Story 2: Backend OAuth Implementation**
   - Implement Passport strategies for Google and GitHub OAuth
   - Create auth endpoints for social login flow
   - Handle user creation/linking for social accounts

3. **Story 3: User Account Linking and Profile Management**
   - Implement logic to link social accounts with existing email accounts
   - Update Organizer schema to store social provider information
   - Add error handling for duplicate account scenarios

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in OAuth implementation
- **Mitigation:** Use well-tested Passport.js strategies, implement proper token validation, follow OAuth 2.0 best practices
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable social login buttons while keeping email auth functional

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Validation Checklist

### Completeness Check:
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Dependencies are identified

## Handoff to Story Manager

---

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running React/TypeScript frontend with NestJS/MongoDB backend
- Integration points: AuthContext and auth components in frontend, Auth module with JWT strategy in backend
- Existing patterns to follow: shadcn/ui component patterns, NestJS module structure, JWT token-based authentication
- Critical compatibility requirements: Existing email-based authentication must continue to work unchanged
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering social login functionality for Google and GitHub providers."
