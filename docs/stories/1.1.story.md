# Story 1.1: NestJS Project Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to initialize a NestJS project with TypeScript and proper folder structure,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the Waitlist backend API system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. NestJS project is initialized with latest stable version
2. TypeScript is configured with strict mode enabled
3. Project structure follows NestJS best practices and conventions
4. Basic configuration files are set up (tsconfig.json, nest-cli.json, etc.)
5. Development and production scripts are configured in package.json
6. Project runs successfully with a basic health check endpoint
7. Git repository is properly initialized with appropriate .gitignore

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize NestJS project (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Use NestJS CLI to create new project: `nest new waitlist-backend`
  - [x] Choose npm as package manager
  - [x] Verify TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json
  - [x] Ensure latest stable NestJS version is installed
- [x] Configure project structure (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Create module folders structure: auth, users, services, participants
  - [x] Set up shared folder for common utilities
  - [x] Create config folder for configuration management
  - [x] Ensure proper barrel exports are in place
- [x] Set up essential configuration files (AC: 4, 5)

  - [x] Set up nest-cli.json for project configuration
  - [x] Create .env.example file for environment variables
  - [x] Configure package.json scripts for dev, build, start, and test
- [x] Implement basic health check (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create a health module
  - [x] Implement GET /health endpoint that returns { status: 'ok' }
  - [x] Test endpoint manually to ensure it works
- [x] Set up version control (AC: 7)
  - [x] Initialize git repository if not already done

  - [x] Include .env, node_modules, dist, and other build artifacts
  - [x] Make initial commit with project setup

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: architecture/3-technology-stack-backend.md]
- **Framework**: Nest.js (Node.js framework) - Provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable server-side application framework based on TypeScript
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (decided for MVP due to flexibility)
- **ORM/ODM**: Mongoose (for MongoDB)
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js for Nest.js
- **Validation**: Class-validator / Class-transformer

### NestJS Dependencies Required
[Source: architecture/9-key-nestjs-dependencies-modules.md]
Core dependencies to be installed:
- `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/platform-express`
- `@nestjs/mongoose` (for MongoDB integration)
- `@nestjs/passport`, `passport-jwt`, `@nestjs/jwt` (for authentication)
- `bcrypt` (for password hashing)
- `class-validator`, `class-transformer` (for validation)
- `dotenv` (for environment variables)

Note: Only install core NestJS dependencies in this story. Other dependencies will be added in relevant stories.

### Project Module Structure
[Source: architecture/4-high-level-architecture-overview.md]
The application should follow this modular architecture:
- **Core Module (app.module.ts)**: Entry point, imports other feature modules
- **Authentication Module (auth.module.ts)**: Handles user registration, login, JWT
- **Users Module (users.module.ts)**: Manages Organizer user data
- **Services Module (services.module.ts)**: Manages Service and Waitlist data
- **Participants Module (participants.module.ts)**: Handles participant sign-ups
- **Global Modules/Middleware**: Logging, Exception Filters, Validation Pipes, Guards

### NestJS Layer Structure
[Source: architecture/4-high-level-architecture-overview.md]
Each module should follow these layers:
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests, route them to services
- **Services**: Contain business logic, interact with repositories/database
- **Repositories/Schemas**: Interact directly with the database
- **DTOs**: Define data structure for incoming requests with validation

### File Naming Conventions
Based on NestJS conventions:
- Modules: `*.module.ts`
- Controllers: `*.controller.ts`
- Services: `*.service.ts`
- DTOs: `*.dto.ts`
- Schemas: `*.schema.ts`
- Interfaces: `*.interface.ts`

### Testing Standards
- No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs
- Follow NestJS testing conventions with Jest (comes with NestJS by default)
- Test files should be colocated with source files: `*.spec.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-01-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent foundation work for a NestJS project. The developer has successfully created a well-structured, production-ready base with proper TypeScript strict mode configuration, comprehensive testing, and appropriate modular architecture. The code follows NestJS best practices and conventions throughout.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/main.ts
  - **Change**: Added Logger, error handling, graceful shutdown hooks, and informative startup logs
  - **Why**: Production applications need proper error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring
  - **How**: This improves operational visibility and ensures the application handles startup failures gracefully

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows NestJS conventions and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Modular architecture correctly implemented with proper separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests and e2e tests are comprehensive and passing
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced main.ts with production-ready error handling and logging
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
- [x] Confirmed proper TypeScript strict mode configuration
- [x] Validated modular folder structure aligns with architecture requirements

### Security Review

- Environment variables properly documented in .env.example
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- Proper .gitignore prevents accidental commit of sensitive files

### Performance Considerations

- Application startup is efficient
- Health check endpoint is lightweight and appropriate for monitoring
- TypeScript strict mode helps catch potential runtime issues at compile time

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation exceeds expectations for a foundation story. The developer demonstrated excellent attention to detail, proper testing practices, and created a solid base for future development. My enhancement to main.ts adds production-ready capabilities without changing the core functionality.
