# Story 1.2: MongoDB Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose integration,
**so that** the application can persist and retrieve data from a MongoDB database.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MongoDB connection is configured using Mongoose with proper connection string handling
2. Environment variables are used for database configuration (connection string, database name)
3. Connection retry logic is implemented for production resilience
4. Proper connection event handlers are set up (connected, error, disconnected)
5. Database connection is tested and verified working
6. ConfigModule is integrated to manage environment variables
7. Mongoose module is properly imported into the main AppModule

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1:
- NestJS project successfully initialized with TypeScript strict mode
- Modular folder structure already in place (config folder exists)
- Health check module implemented - can be extended for database health checks
- Environment variable example file (.env.example) already created
- Main.ts has proper error handling and logging setup by QA

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: architecture/3-technology-stack-backend.md]
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL Document Database)
  - Rationale: Flexible schema, suitable for rapid prototyping and evolving data models, scales horizontally
  - Decision: For MVP, MongoDB offers more flexibility
- **ORM/ODM**: Mongoose (for MongoDB)

### Required Dependencies
[Source: architecture/9-key-nestjs-dependencies-modules.md]
- `@nestjs/mongoose` - NestJS wrapper for Mongoose
- `mongoose` - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- `@nestjs/config` - Configuration module for NestJS (replaces dotenv approach)

### Database Schemas Overview
[Source: architecture/6-database-schema-mongodb-using-mongoose.md]
The following schemas will be implemented in future stories:
- **organizers** collection: User authentication data
- **services** collection: Waitlist service definitions
- **waitlistParticipants** collection: Participant registrations

Note: This story focuses only on database connection setup, not schema implementation.

### NestJS Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/4-high-level-architecture-overview.md]
- Modular architecture: Each feature has its own module
- Database interaction will happen through:
  - **Repositories/Schemas**: Mongoose schemas and models
  - **Services**: Business logic that uses the repositories
  - Controllers should not directly interact with database

### Configuration Best Practices
- Use ConfigModule for all environment variables
- Validate environment variables at startup
- Never commit actual .env files (only .env.example)
- Use connection pooling for production performance
- Implement graceful shutdown for database connections

### File Locations
Based on project structure from Story 1.1:
- Database configuration: `src/config/database.config.ts`
- Database module: `src/modules/database/database.module.ts`
- Environment types: `src/config/env.validation.ts`
- Updated files: `src/app.module.ts`, `.env.example`

### Testing Requirements
- Integration tests should use a test database or in-memory MongoDB
- Health checks should verify database connectivity
- Connection retry logic should be tested with mock failures
- All tests must pass before marking story complete
