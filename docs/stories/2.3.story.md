# Story 2.3: Waitlist Business Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** waitlist organizer using the integrated frontend-backend system,
**I want** to create and manage waitlists through the frontend dashboard with real backend data persistence,
**so that** I can offer real waitlist functionality to my participants and manage them effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Organizers can create and manage waitlists through frontend dashboard using real backend
2. Waitlist data persists in backend MongoDB database
3. Public waitlist pages load real data from backend by slug/ID
4. Anonymous users can join waitlists, with data saved to backend database
5. Participant counts and statistics reflect real database values
6. CSV export downloads actual participant data from backend
7. All mock data removed from frontend project
8. Error handling works correctly between frontend and backend

- `waitlist-backend/src/modules/participants/participants.module.ts` - Participants module
- `waitlist-backend/src/app.module.ts` - Add Services and Participants modules

**Frontend Files to Create/Modify:**
- `front/listly-ease/src/services/waitlist.service.ts` - API client for waitlist operations
- `front/listly-ease/src/types/waitlist.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- `front/listly-ease/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Update with real API integration
- `front/listly-ease/src/components/waitlist/WaitlistJoinForm.tsx` - Update with real API
- `front/listly-ease/src/pages/WaitlistPage.tsx` - Update public waitlist page with real data

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-error-handling-validation.md]
- Use global exception filters for consistent JSON error responses
- Implement class-validator decorators in DTOs for automatic validation
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 409, 500)
- Frontend should parse and display error messages from backend
- Handle specific business logic errors (slug conflicts, duplicate emails per waitlist)

### Security Considerations
- All service management endpoints require JWT authentication
- Public endpoints should validate input but remain accessible to anonymous users
- Ensure organizers can only access their own services and participant data
- Validate slug uniqueness across all services
- Prevent duplicate participant emails within the same waitlist

### Cross-Project Integration Requirements
Based on Epic 2 requirements:
- Frontend communicates with backend via existing proxy configuration (`/api/*` → `localhost:3001`)
- CORS already configured in backend to accept requests from `localhost:8080`
- JWT token management already implemented in frontend auth context
- Both projects maintain independent development and deployment capabilities

### Testing Standards

**Backend Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for Services and Participants service methods
- Unit tests for Controllers with mocked dependencies
- E2E tests for complete CRUD operations and public endpoints
- Test files follow `.spec.ts` pattern alongside source files
- Use Jest testing framework (already configured)
- Mock database connections in unit tests
- Test CSV export functionality with sample data
- Test authentication guards on protected endpoints

**Frontend Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for waitlist service API client
- Component tests for updated dashboard and waitlist components
- Integration tests for complete waitlist creation and joining flows
- Test error handling and loading states
- Use existing testing framework consistent with authentication tests

**Integration Testing:**
- Test complete flow: create service → public access → participant join → CSV export
- Verify data persistence across page refreshes and sessions
- Test error scenarios (service not found, duplicate emails, unauthorized access)
- Ensure both projects work together seamlessly in development environment

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing authentication system (Stories 2.1-2.2)
- Frontend UI components may need updates but should preserve existing macOS-style design
- Both projects must remain independently deployable
- API calls use existing Vite proxy configuration
- Must follow established NestJS modular architecture patterns
- Replace ALL mock data in frontend - no mock data should remain in production

- ✅ CSV export with proper file generation
- ✅ Cross-origin communication properly configured
- ✅ All tests passing (109/109)
- ✅ Both projects build successfully

### Minor Refactoring Opportunities

#### Backend
1. **Type Assertions**: Consider creating proper response DTOs instead of using `(service._id as any).toString()`
2. **Response Serialization**: Could implement a response transformer for consistent API responses
3. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more specific for better debugging

#### Frontend  
1. **Loading States**: Could implement more granular loading indicators per service action
2. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Could replace native `confirm()` with custom modal components
3. **URL Generation**: Hard-coded waitlist URL generation could use environment configuration

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries are properly indexed for optimal performance
- API responses include only necessary data
- Frontend implements proper loading states to manage perceived performance
- CSV generation is efficient for reasonable dataset sizes

### Security Review
- ✅ All protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- ✅ Organizer ownership validation prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Input validation comprehensive with class-validator
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- ✅ Proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### Integration Testing Results
- ✅ Complete waitlist creation flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Public waitlist joining persists data correctly
