# Story 4.1: Responsive Layout Foundation & Core Pages

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** waitlist user (both organizer and participant),
**I want** the application to adapt its layout responsively across different device sizes,
**so that** I can have an optimal viewing and interaction experience whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile while maintaining the exact current design on desktop

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Responsive breakpoint standards are configured in Tailwind config (mobile <640px, tablet 640px-1024px, desktop ≥1024px)
2. Desktop layout (≥1024px) remains exactly unchanged from current design - no visual regression
3. Index page (/) implements responsive layout with proper content stacking on mobile/tablet
4. Dashboard page implements responsive grid layout that adapts from multi-column to single column
5. Login and Signup pages center properly on all screen sizes with responsive form widths
6. Reusable responsive utility classes are created for common patterns (containers, grids, spacing)
7. Mobile layouts (<640px) have minimum touch target sizes of 44x44px for interactive elements
8. Tablet layouts (640px-1024px) optimize content flow without horizontal scrolling
9. All text remains readable without horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
10. Navigation components adapt appropriately (consider hamburger menu for mobile in future story)

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack
[Source: Epic document & package.json]
- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.11 for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Vite build system
- React Router 6.26.2 for navigation

### File Locations
[Source: Project structure analysis]
- Page components: `/front/listly-ease/src/pages/`
  - Index.tsx - Landing page
  - DashboardPage.tsx - Organizer dashboard
  - LoginPage.tsx - Login form page
  - SignupPage.tsx - Registration form page
- Components: `/front/listly-ease/src/components/`
- Tailwind config: `/front/listly-ease/tailwind.config.ts`
- Global styles: `/front/listly-ease/src/index.css`

### Current Tailwind Configuration
[Source: tailwind.config.ts]
- Container is centered with 2rem padding
- Container screens defined as 2xl: 1400px only
- Custom color scheme with CSS variables
- Border radius variables using --radius
- No responsive breakpoints currently defined beyond defaults

### Responsive Implementation Strategy
[Source: Epic technical notes]
```css
Breakpoint Strategy:
- Mobile: < 640px (Tailwind sm: boundary)  
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px (sm: to lg:)
- Desktop: ≥ 1024px (lg: and above)
```

### Key Patterns to Follow
[Source: Epic document]
- Use mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Desktop styles should use lg: prefix to preserve current design
- Use min-width media queries to isolate desktop styles
- Grid layouts: Multi-column on desktop → 2-column tablet → single column mobile
- Forms: Horizontal fields on desktop → stacked fields on mobile
- No changes to component logic, only Tailwind utility classes

### Important Constraints
[Source: Epic requirements]
- CRITICAL: Desktop layout must remain 100% unchanged - no visual regression
- All current design elements preserved without modifications
- Only CSS/Tailwind changes - no component logic changes
- Performance impact must be minimal (CSS-only implementation)

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 3.3 completion]
- Social login implementation is complete and working
- Authentication system has been enhanced with provider linking
- Login/Signup pages now include social login buttons that need responsive consideration

## Testing
[Source: Front-end architecture considerations]
- Use browser DevTools responsive mode for breakpoint testing
- Test on actual devices when possible (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Verify using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge browsers
- Check both portrait and landscape orientations on mobile/tablet
- Use Vite dev server for hot-reload testing during development
- No specific testing framework mentioned for frontend (consider manual testing)
