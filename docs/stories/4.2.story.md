# Story 4.2: Service & Waitlist Pages Responsive Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** waitlist organizer and participant,
**I want** the service management and waitlist pages to be responsive across all device sizes,
**so that** I can effectively create, manage, and join services whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile while maintaining optimal user experience and touch accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ServiceDetailPage implements responsive layout with proper content stacking on mobile/tablet
2. CreateServicePage forms adapt to different screen sizes with touch-friendly inputs
3. WaitlistPage displays participant information optimally on all device sizes
4. All form inputs and interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum touch target on mobile
5. Tables and data displays optimize for smaller screens (responsive table design or card view)
6. Forms stack vertically on mobile and arrange horizontally on larger screens where appropriate
7. Navigation and action buttons remain accessible on all breakpoints
8. Desktop layout (≥1024px) remains exactly unchanged from current design - no visual regression

  - Multi-section service creation form
  - Service details inputs (name, description, slug)
  - Waitlist configuration options
  - Form validation and submission handling
- **WaitlistPage components:**
  - Public service information display
  - Waitlist join form with participant details
  - Success/confirmation messaging
  - Service branding and visual elements

### Responsive Implementation Strategy
[Source: Epic document & Story 4.1 technical notes]
- Use mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Desktop styles should use lg: prefix to preserve current design
- Grid layouts: Multi-column on desktop → 2-column tablet → single column mobile
- Forms: Horizontal fields on desktop → stacked fields on mobile
- Tables: Full table on desktop → horizontal scroll or card view on mobile
- Only CSS/Tailwind changes - no component logic changes

### Touch Target Requirements
[Source: Epic requirements & accessibility standards]
- All interactive elements must be minimum 44x44px on mobile
- Form inputs should have adequate height for touch interaction
- Buttons and links need proper spacing for finger accessibility
- Table actions and controls must be touch-friendly

### Data Display Optimization
[Source: UI/UX specifications & responsive design patterns]
- Participant tables: Consider card-based layout for mobile
- Service metrics: Stack vertically on mobile, arrange horizontally on desktop
- Form sections: Group related fields and stack on smaller screens
- Navigation elements: Prioritize primary actions on mobile

### Important Constraints
[Source: Epic requirements]
- CRITICAL: Desktop layout must remain 100% unchanged - no visual regression
- All current design elements preserved without modifications
- Only CSS/Tailwind changes - no component logic changes
- Performance impact must be minimal (CSS-only implementation)
- Maintain existing functionality across all breakpoints

## Testing
[Source: Story 4.1 testing approach]
- Use browser DevTools responsive mode for breakpoint testing
- Test form interactions and table displays on actual mobile devices
- Verify using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge browsers
- Check both portrait and landscape orientations on mobile/tablet
- Use Vite dev server for hot-reload testing during development
- Focus on touch interaction testing for forms and data tables
