# Story 5.1: Implement WaitRush Dark Theme Color System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** WaitRush user (gamers, early adopters, developers),
**I want** the application to have a dark-mode base theme with electric yellow lightning accents,
**so that** I experience a gaming-focused aesthetic that appeals to my tech-savvy preferences while maintaining all existing functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Update CSS custom properties from blue/light theme to dark base with yellow accents
2. Modify Tailwind configuration for new color palette 
3. Create lightning-themed visual elements and iconography
4. Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility in dark theme
5. Maintain existing component structure and functionality
6. All existing user flows work identically with new visual design
7. Performance impact is minimal (CSS-only changes)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories in this epic. This is the foundational color system story that enables subsequent rebranding and UI enhancement stories.

### Tech Stack Context
[Source: Project Memory - project_overview]
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Library**: ShadcN UI + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Styling System**: CSS custom properties with HSL values + Tailwind configuration

### Current Color System Architecture
[Source: front/listly-ease/src/index.css lines 8-121]
The application uses a CSS custom properties system with:
- `:root` section defining light theme variables (lines 8-74)
- `.dark` section defining dark theme overrides (lines 76-121)
- HSL color format throughout: `hsl(var(--variable-name))`
- Tailwind integration via `tailwind.config.ts` color extensions

### Target Color Transformation
[Source: docs/waitrush-ui-ux-redesign-epic.md]
**FROM (Current System):**
- Primary: Blue hsl(210 100% 50%) 
- Background: Light hsl(220 25% 97%)
- Theme: macOS-inspired glassmorphism

**TO (WaitRush System):**
- Primary: Electric Yellow hsl(51 100% 50%)
- Background: Dark base hsl(0 0% 10%)
- Theme: Gaming/tech-focused dark mode with lightning accents

### File Locations
[Source: Project Structure]
- Main CSS file: `front/listly-ease/src/index.css`
- Tailwind config: `front/listly-ease/tailwind.config.ts`
- Component library: `front/listly-ease/src/components/ui/`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: Epic Requirements]
- Must maintain existing component structure
- No functional changes allowed
- CSS-only modifications
- Preserve accessibility standards
- Maintain performance (no additional bundle size)

### Integration Approach
[Source: docs/waitrush-ui-ux-redesign-epic.md]
- Utilize existing CSS custom properties system (lines 8-121 in index.css)
- Leverage existing dark mode infrastructure (lines 76-121)
- Update glassmorphism effects for dark theme compatibility
- Maintain all existing animation and transition systems

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: No specific testing architecture found in docs]
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. For this CSS-only story:

- **Visual Regression Testing**: Manual verification across all major pages
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use browser dev tools to verify WCAG AA compliance
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge compatibility
- **Responsive Testing**: Verify color system works across all breakpoints
- **Component Testing**: Ensure all ShadcN UI and custom components render correctly
